# Objective of the project
Key Objectives
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Gather and preprocess stock market data from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
Clean the data to handle missing values, remove outliers, and prepare it for analysis.
Predictive Modeling:

Use machine learning models like Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), or other time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future stock prices.
Evaluate model accuracy using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
Visualization of Trends:

Create clear and interactive visualizations to showcase:
Historical stock price trends.
Predicted future prices over a specified horizon.
Key performance indicators (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
Highlight the divergence between predicted and actual values.
User-Friendly Analysis:

Develop an intuitive interface for users to:
Select specific stocks for visualization.
Adjust prediction parameters (e.g., prediction window).
Compare multiple stocks side by side.
Insights for Decision-Making:

Provide actionable insights to support investment decisions:
Identify trends and patterns.
Highlight periods of high risk or opportunity.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Library used: 
-Numpy: For efficient numerical computations and generating random numbers
-Pandas: Useful for organizing and analyzing the data generated by a simulation
-Matplotlib:For 2D/3D plots of the random walk
 # DataSource(s)
 The dataset used in this project is not available on Kaggle or other public repositories. Therefore, it was created independently for the purpose of this analysis.
 # ExecutionSteps(Howtoruntheproject)
 1. Set Up the Environment: Install Python and the necessary libraries
 2. Download/Prepare the Project Files
 3. Open the Script/Notebook
 4. Run the Simulation:
 5. Visualize Results: Look at the output plots (line graph) generated by the code & Save the plots if needed (use plt. savefig() in the code).
 6.  Analyze it.
# Summary of Results
This project aims to develop a Python-based stock price prediction and visualization tool, providing users with valuable insights into market trends and potential future price movements. The project will enable users to analyze and forecast stock prices by leveraging historical stock data and advanced machine learning models, supporting informed investment decisions.

Key Features:
Data Handling and Preprocessing:

Acquire historical stock data dynamically via APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).
Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and reliability for modeling.
Predictive Analytics:

Machine learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or ARIMA are used to forecast future stock prices.
Evaluate the performance of predictions using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
Data Visualization:

Create interactive charts to visualize:
Historical stock trends.
Predicted future prices and their comparison with actual data.
Technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
User Interaction:

Allow users to select specific stocks and define prediction parameters.
Provide insights through side-by-side comparisons of different stocks.
Deployment:

Develop a user-friendly interface using web-based frameworks like Flask, Dash, or Streamlit.
Deploy the tool locally or on the cloud for easy access.
Outcomes:
A comprehensive tool for analyzing and visualizing stock market trends.
Support for investors and analysts in making informed decisions based on predictive insights.
A foundation for future enhancements, such as incorporating live data updates and advanced forecasting models
