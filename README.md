# Objectiveof the project
Key Objectives
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Gather and preprocess stock market data from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
Clean the data to handle missing values, remove outliers, and prepare it for analysis.
Predictive Modeling:

Use machine learning models like Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), or other time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future stock prices.
Evaluate model accuracy using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
Visualization of Trends:

Create clear and interactive visualizations to showcase:
Historical stock price trends.
Predicted future prices over a specified horizon.
Key performance indicators (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
Highlight the divergence between predicted and actual values.
User-Friendly Analysis:

Develop an intuitive interface for users to:
Select specific stocks for visualization.
Adjust prediction parameters (e.g., prediction window).
Compare multiple stocks side by side.
Insights for Decision-Making:

Provide actionable insights to support investment decisions:
Identify trends and patterns.
Highlight periods of high risk or opportunity.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Library used: 
-Numpy: For efficient numerical computations and generating random numbers
-Pandas: Useful for organizing and analyzing the data generated by a simulation
-Matplotlib:For 2D/3D plots of the random walk
 # DataSource(s)
 The dataset used in this project is not available on Kaggle or other public repositories. Therefore, it was created independently for the purpose of this analysis.
 # ExecutionSteps(Howtoruntheproject)
 1. Set Up the Environment: Install Python and the necessary libraries
 2. Download/Prepare the Project Files
 3. Open the Script/Notebook
 4. Run the Simulation:
 5. Visualize Results: Look at the output plots (line graph) generated by the code & Save the plots if needed (use plt. savefig() in the code).
 6.  Analyze it.
# SummaryofResults
The results of a random walk simulation depend on its configuration.
1. Key Metrics
-Number of Steps: Total steps simulated per walk.
-Final Position: The end position of the walk relative to the starting point (0).
-Displacement: The distance from the starting point (e.g., |Final Position| in 1D, or Euclidean distance in 2D).
-Return to Origin: The number of times the walk returned to the starting point.
-Average Position: Mean position over all steps.
-Variance in Position: Measure of the spread of the walk over steps.
2. Observations from Simulation
-1D Random Walk:
Positions fluctuate between positive and negative values due to random steps.
Over multiple simulations, the mean position is approximately zero, and variance grows linearly with the number of steps.
A random walk is unbiased, but extreme values may occur over long steps.
-2D Random Walk:
The path appears chaotic, with the walker covering more area as steps increase.
The distance from the origin increases with the square root of the number of steps (on average).
3. Visualizations
-Line Graphs (1D Walk):
Show the fluctuation of position over time.
Clear indication of randomness with no predictable pattern.
4. Insights
Random walks simulate unpredictable, yet statistically explainable, phenomena.
Applications include modeling diffusion, stock prices, and other real-world stochastic systems.
